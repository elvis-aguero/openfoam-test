# Knowledge Base (Stable Facts Only)
- Repo map (key dirs/modules):
  - `main.py`: Interactive manager for building/running cases.
  - `circularTiltingTank`: OpenFOAM template directory.
  - `case_*`: Individual simulation case folders.
  - `mesh_quality.py`, `yl_nonlin.py`: Support scripts for mesh and pre-processing.
- Build/test commands:
  - `python3 main.py` to start the interactive manager.
- Style/conventions:
  - OpenFOAM 13 syntax for dictionaries (notably `setFieldsDict`).
- Dependency/tooling notes:
  - OpenFOAM, Gmsh, Slurm (if on Oscar).
- Known pitfalls:
  - `setFields` syntax change in OF13.
  - `pRefPoint` must be inside the mesh.
  - Mesh quality (MSH2 format) is critical for performance.
